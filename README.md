# Digit-Recogniser---Kaggle-challenge

I have recently participate in a Kaggle Challenge - Digit Recognizer because I saw on the leaderbroad there are some people obtained accurancy score 1 and I was so curious about how they can do that. Overall the best result I obtained is just 0.9967 that is ranked on 6% of leaderbroad and I'm trying to improve them more.
